# MySQL Box
This is a quick and dirty example of using vagrant to bootstrap a tiny
(256mb!) virtual machine running mysql-server with some data pre-loaded
in it. 

## Running It
To run this you will need

* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Once those are installed, clone this repository and type `vagrant up`
